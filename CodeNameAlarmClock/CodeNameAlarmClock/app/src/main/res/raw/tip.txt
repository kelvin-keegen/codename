This window activity initiates a QRCODE simulator scan. On pressing the button below
a simulator scanner will initiate turning your phones camera
into a barcode or a QRcode reader. In relation to the simulation in this alarm clock
app, you are required to scan a Barcode (mainly found on your shampoo or any other product
in your house hold) to quit this annoying ringing. You have no choice but to wake-up and
scan a barcode of your own preference for this alarm to be turned off. Have a GoodDay!!!
